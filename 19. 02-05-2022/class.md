### Call - Apply - Bind
- All functions are object methods
- If a function is not a method of a JS object, it is a function of the global object


### call
- with call(), an object can use a method belonging to another object

### apply
- same as call
- The difference is , call takes arguments separately whereas apply takes arguments as any array

### bind
- With the bind method, an object can borrow a method from another object
