## Intro to JavaScript


- Till now we've learnt 2 new things -
 - HTML
 - CSS

- Then we learnt bootstrap(library)

- JavaScript (backbone of web D, especially frontend)

- React(library) - written in JS

- Later when you learn backend, you'll see nodejs(backend runtime env) - written in JS


- With JS in frontend, we have 3 options
 1. Vanilla JavaScript - no external libraries or frameworks
 2. ReactJS - library
 3. Angular


### Where can I write JS?

1. Browser console
2. Any html file, inside script tag
3. Multiple script tags in a single html file are allowed
4. Link external script file

- window - the browser object model - it allows the JS to talk to the browser
- window.document or document
