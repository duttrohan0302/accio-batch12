### Extracting String Parts
- slice(start, end) => slice extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string, end position is not included
- substring(start, end) => Similar to slice, but substring cannot accept negative values
- substr(start, length) => Similar to slice, but substr's second argument is the length
